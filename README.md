# systemDesign_class

The bladeless small wind turbine system employs model-based design, utilizing **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** in **COMSOL Multiphysics** and model implementation through **Simulink**. The system's optimization is carried out using **Python** to ensure the most efficient design parameters are met.

The key components of the design process include:
- **COMSOL Multiphysics**: Used for performing detailed **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** to simulate mechanical and structural behaviors under various environmental conditions.
- **Simulink**: Employed to model and simulate the dynamic behaviors of the wind turbine, including electrical and mechanical aspects.
- **Python**: Applied for optimization, ensuring the design parameters are finely tuned for maximum performance, leveraging various optimization algorithms.

This model-based approach allows for a thorough analysis and iterative refinement of the turbine system, ensuring it meets efficiency and performance standards in a controlled, virtual environment before physical prototype development.
